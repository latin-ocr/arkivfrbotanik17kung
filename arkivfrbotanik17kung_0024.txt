time regarded as a subgenus of Polypodium. The idea of a
relationship in this direction has since been elaborated‚ espe'-
cia-Hy by SEWARD. Professor SEWARD and Miss DALE (1900,
1901) proposed the removal of Dipteris from the Polypodiaceae
to form a separate family and brought to this family several
Mesozoic genera, among them Dictyophyllum. It seems to
have been the general opinion since then, that Dictyophyllum
and other similar genera are actual members of the Dipteri-
dinae: ZEILLER (1903, p. 97), for instance, says that SEWARD &a
DALE's attribution of the genus to that family »semble ab·
solument justifiee».

NATHORST, however, in his memoir on Dictyophyllum
and Camptopteris remarks on several important points of
difference between Dictyophsyllum and Dipterz‘s. He points
out especially that the sporangia of Dictyophyllum occur in
a smaller number in each sorus, are much larger and more
rounded than those of Dipteris, and apparently have a some—
what better developed annulus. NATHORST does not express
any definite opinion as to whether Dictyoplzyllum should be
referred to the Dipteridinae in spite of these differences or
not, but he remarks that it might be a more cautious course
to place it provisionally in a separate sub—family for which
he proposes the name Camptopteridinae.

As the affinities of Dictyophyllum are thus not yet settled
beyond dispute, Ι have made a renewed examination of the
Stoekholm material of Dictyophyllum exile in the hope of dis-
covering some new details of interest.

The number of sporangia in each sorus cannot be very
clearly seen in the material Ι have examined, on account
of the crowded position of the sporangia. NATHORST, how-
ever, has been able to state that the number is probably 4—7.

On the question whether the annulus is complete or‘not
there are different opinions. The older writers, for instance
Go'PPER'r and SCHENK, speak of the annulus as complete, but
nowadays it is usually held to be incomplete (ZEILLER 1893,
p. 97; NATHORs'r 1906, p. 13).

In the specimens which I have examined, it is only rarely
that the whole extension of the annulus ean be traced. The
whole annulus is shown only when the plane of the annulus
is parallel with the bedding of the rock and when it is at the
same time free of the adjacent sporangia. In pl. 2, figs. 13—-16
