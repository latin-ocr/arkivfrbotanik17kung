matopteris because it has large sporangia covering the whole
lower surfacc of the pinnae. He remarks on the absence of
any sign of a pore or an annulus. In a later paper (1864 a,
p. 34) he again mentions the differcnce between this type and
Taenioptcris and points out the very close agreement with
the genera Danaea and Anqz'opteris in regard to the habit and
the venation.

HEER, who mentions the new name Danaeopsis for the
first time in his »Urwelt der Schweiz» (1864, p. 543 pl. 2, fig. 5)
does not give any description of the sori or sporangia in that
place, beyond mention-ing that the frond on its lower side is
covered with globular sporangia placed in two rows. In his
»Flora Fossilis Helvetiae» (1876—77, p. 71, 111. 24, fig. 1) 116
gives further illustrations of the sporangia and discusses the
affinities of the genus. The sporangia of Danaeopsis are stated
to be biseriate‚ placed in linear sori which are inserted on
the veins. He is not able to decide whether the densely placed
sporangia are really fused, as in Danae& but he thinks that at
any rate the fusion cannot be so close as in that genus, because
the individual sporangia can always be clearly distinguished.
In his description of the species D. marantacea, the sporangia
are stated to be globular, exannular, and to open by a trans-
verse slit. The rows of sporangia are placed two and two,
but each pair of rows is not »surrounded by a receptaculum»,
as in Danaea, this being a difference between the fossil and
the living genus. In habit and venation the species is stated
to recall Danaea, also in the fact that the sporangia are placed
in two closely approached rows, which follow the secondary
veins from the midrib to the margin, while in Anqiopteris
they only form a band along the margin. In regard to the
shape of the frond, to the venation and the arrangement of
the sori, HEER further compares Danaeopsis marantacea with
the recent species Gymnoqmmme javanica, which, however, is
recognized as having smaller and differently arranged spor-
angia.

SCHIMPER in his »Traite de paleontologie vegetale» gives
a diagnosis of the genus in which the sporangia are said to be
uniseriate‚ but nothing is stated in regard to the mode of de-
hiscence or the relation to Danaea. The ›>Palaeophytologie»
(1879—1880, p. 88) contains the following remark on the spor-
angia: »Sporangien in dichtgedrangten Reihen bis zum
