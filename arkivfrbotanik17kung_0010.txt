(1909 a, p. 22) substituted 101· Danaeopsis HR. the generic
name Pseudodanaeopsis FONTAINE (1883, p. 58).

F ONTAINE had founded his genus Pseudodanaeopsis on
a species which he called Ps. reticulata. The genus differs,
according to him, from Danaeopsis HR. through the more
frequent anastomosing of the secondary veins. While Da-
naeopsis is described as showing not rarely an anastomosis
of the lateral nerves, the species of Pseudodanaeopsis have
always the secondary nerves anastomosed‚ and this is clearly
no sporadic occurrence (FONTAINE‚ l. c.).

KRASSER (1909 6, p. 23) states that the name Danacopsis
HR. cannot be regarded as valid because the name had been
used at an earlier date by PRESL (1845, p. 39) for a section of
the genus Danaea. He proposes to use FONTAINE's name
Pseudodanaeopsis also for the species previously referred to
Danaeopsis‚ on the ground that the type species D. marantacea
may show at least marginal anastomoses and that the ana-
stomosing of the veins occurs in varying degree also in the
species of FONTAINE’s genus.

Finally‚ SEWARD (1910, p. 407) includes Danaeopsis
marantacea (PRESL) HEER in Marattiopsis Sommn, this name
being employed in a very wide sense —- »interpreted as indic-
ating a family resemblance rather than special affinity to
the genus Marattia» (SEWARD 1. 6., p. 408).

Of the different generic names proposed for the species
in question M arattiopsis would seem to be better employed
in a narrow sense, and in that case the Danaeopsis-type 01
ΗΕΕΒ. (1065 1101 fall within its limits. In several Mesozoic
floras there occur forms with a very distinct M arania-type
of sorus and agreeing also in other respects so closely with
the recent genus that no difference can be traced, sufficient
to serve as a generic distinction. If ever a natural genus,
founded both on habit and on soral characters, can be distin-
guished in a fossil state, this 15 0116. It may be questioned
whether these forms should not be referred unreservedly to the
recent genus M arattia. But if we object to referring a Mesozoic
plant to a recent genus, the best plan would seem to be to use

the name Marattz‘opsis for the forms which show the soral ᾗ

61161661615 of M arattia. It 15 true that SOHIMPER did not
create the name M araitiopsis for these forms, which he referred
topkAnqiopteridium instead, but for a sterile Tertiary frond
