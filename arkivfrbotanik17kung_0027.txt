HALLE, ΟΝ Tum SPORANGIA OF SOME MESOZOIC FERNS. 19

p. 177; BOWER 1908, p. 566). They are, however, smaller

,than those of Dictyophyllzom. In regard to 1116 shape of 1116

sporangium *Maionia shows a greater resemblance 10 Dc'ciyo-
phyllum than does Dipteris, but, as in 1116 latter genus, 1116

’ annulus is more markedly incomplete than in Dictyoplzylluw.¹

The difference in 1116 size of 1116 sporangia and the num-
ber of spores, as well as the greater extension of the annulus,
precludes an actual classifica‘oion of Dicbyophyllzcm under
either 1116 Dipteridinae or the Matoniaceae, of which the
latter family seems to be 1116 0116 more closely related. If
we assume with BOWER a phylogenetic series Μ alonia-Dip-
teris 11 would be natural, however, 10 range Dictyophyllum
with 11 as an earlier member, characterized by larger sporangia,
and a greater number of spores in the spol-angium. These
characters, as well as 1116 more nearly complete state of the
annulus, may point 10 a relationship also with 1116 Gleichenia-
ceae. For practical purposes of classification, 11 would seem
1ο be best to use 1116 provisional family name Camptopteri-
dinae proposed by NATHORs‘r.

Hausmannia DUNK.

The genus Hausmamzia DUNK., of which Protorhipis
ANDRAE is now held 10 be a synonyni, is generally compared
with Dictyophyllum. Like that genus, Hausmannia is now
regarded as a member of 1116 Dipteridinae, 10 which family 11
was first shown by ZEILLER 10 bear a close resemblance (ΖΕΗ,-
LER, 1897, p. 513 compare SEWARD & DALE 1901, p. 502 and
foll.). Since 11 has become clear (compare above p. 18) that
Dictyophyllum cannot well be brought 10 1116 same family
as the recent Dipteridinae‚ 1116 question arises whether the
same is 1116 case with Hausmannia. The sporangia of that
genus have never been described, its reference to the Dipteri-

· dinae being founded merely 011 1116 habit and the venation
