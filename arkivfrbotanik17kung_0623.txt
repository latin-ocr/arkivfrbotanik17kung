Jn June of 1920 while on an expedition with Dr. O.
30RGE, a plankton catch was made from a small artificial
oenamental pool in front of the castle at Rydboholm‚ north-
ast of Stockholm. Examination of this material showed
ο many striking organisms that collections were also made
tom the artificial Monoeotyledonous and Dicotyledonous pools
ff the Stockholm Botanical Garden (Hortus Bergianus) in

e hope that these too might have an interesting plankton
ra. While no plankton algae of great interest were found
'Sp these latter pools, the results are incorporated in the
pble of organisms observed as a contribution towards our
*eowledge of the plankton flora of artificial pools.

The frequency of the different- algae at the various sta—
ᾖ ns is shown by the following abbreviations in the table:

) very rare, (r) rare, (ss) very scarae, (8) scarce, (e) com-
n, (co) very common.
