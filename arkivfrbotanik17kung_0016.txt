1110 margin; and 11 this is also the case in the fertile pinnae
— which cannot be seen -— it is clear that the course of the
veins and the sori cannot coincide. In most places where
both sporangia and veins can be examined the sori are placed
not over 1110 secondary veins but between thern. This is shown,
for instance, in pl. 1, figs. 7—10. In the places here figured
the sporangia have been partly removed, and the veins thus
exposed. The veins do not correspond 10 the median line
01 1110 801118 but to the border line between two 8011. 111 other
cases the relation is not 80 01001, and, on the whole, the relation
between the sori and 1110 veins is somewhat irregular. The
sori, 101 instance, do not follow the curve 01 the veins as these
bend downwards 10 ]’0111 1110 midrib, but continue straight
in the same direction as nearer the margin. The large sporangia.
no doubt require an abundant vascular supply, but this seems
to be 011001οά by smaller strands which cannot be seen in the
specimen. The relation between the sori and the secondary
veins as here described is not what would be expected, but
somewhat similar conditions were found on an examination
01 0 couple 01 specimens 01 typical Danaeopsis marantacea.
Pl. 2, fig. 27, 18 0 photograph — about thrice the natural
size — 01 0 specimen 01 Danaeopsis marantacea from Neue
Welt near Basel. The photograph gives an idea 01 the dense
irregular nature 01 the venation. The veins are more nu-
merous 111011 the sori, and they are not strictly parallel, as are
the sori, but join, and possibly cross, each other in many places.
Moreover the veins are 01 varying thickness. In pl. 2, fig. 29
at a and in figs. 28 and 30, it would appear as 11 the thicker
veins corresponded to the borders between the sori, as in the
Scanian D. secunda described above, while in each case a
narrower vein corresponds to the median line 01 the sorus.
In other cases, however, the relation is quite irregular. At
any rate it is evident that the venation is much denser in the

fertile pinna than in sterile ones — as is only natural in regard ν

to the great number and size 01 the sporangia. In addition
to the ordinary veins 01 the sterile pinnae there is thus in the
fertile pinna 0 set 01 irregular and probably anastomosing
finer nerves supplying the sporangia. It 18 possible that the
veins of different thickness are at different levels, the thicker
ones being more deeply embedded in the parenchyma than
the finer ones supplying the sporangia.
