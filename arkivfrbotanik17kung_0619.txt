nvestigated. The reduction division is normal in O. Papaya,
J. can,damarcensis and perhaps also in C. clm-gysopetala.

4) In G. pentaqona both normal and aberrant reduction
pindles are found, the latter showing an almost total failure.
if chromosome conjugation. Ovules are sometimes found
with two mother-cells, one of which shows complete, the
¹ther one defective conjugation. It is also possible that the
onjugation is different in different individuals. Mother-cells
with defective chromosome conjugation give rise to diploid
οι· almost diploid) embryo-sacs which may perhaps be
apable of apomictical development.

5) Ο. chrysopetala and C. pentaqona are dicecious and
:tale individuals are lacking. Both species are almost to-
ally parthenocarpic‚ only very few seeds being found in
ach fruit. It is untertain whether these seeds are of apo-
aictical or of hybrid origin. In the latter case O. canda-
zarcensis must be the male parent.

6) According to the theory of ERNST(1918) this parthe-
=ocarpy should be regarded as an outcome of previous cros-
ing. It is, however, stated that no decisive proof can be
ound by means of taxonomical and cytological studies for
»r against such an assumption.
