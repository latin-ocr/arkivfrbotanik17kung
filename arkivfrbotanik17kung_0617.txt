Ο. HEILBORN, CYTOLOGICAL STUDIES ΟΝ CARICA. 13

Vhich of the two alternatives is the right one, or whether
erhaps both kinds of seeds are produced, can only be deter-
iined by means of experimental work.

It is desirable from a horticultural point of view that
'ich work should soon be carried out in the tropicS, because
§eds produced by crossing would not, of course, breed true
nd, consequently, they would not be suitable for the pur-
ose of introducing these species into other countries. Be-
des we do not even know as yet whether the seeds of
'. chrysopetala and O. pentaqona really are capable of germi-
ation.

The original purpose of this investigation was to look
›r some indication of hybrid origin of O. chrysopetala and
. pentaymza, as, according to the theory of ERNST (1918),
rossing might be thought of as the probable cause of the
arthenocarpy in these species. As stated above, from taxo-
omieal studies no conclusions can be drawn for or against
iis hybrid-hypothesis. Again, as regards cytology, the de-
eient conjugation of the chromosomes in the heterotypic
ivision would seem to reveal those vestiges of crossing that
'ere looked for, as non-conjugation has been found as a
iaraeteristic of many hybrids. Conjugation is also lacking
[apogamous species, many of which have proved to be
acient hybrids. Hence it is obvious that the non-conjuga-
on of the chromosomes in O. pentaqona may be regarded
ι a rather strong proof of the hybrid origin of that species.
here is, however, an objection to be made against this
&gumentation As indicated above, the degree of conjuga-
on seems to depend more, perhaps, on the physiological
roperties of the different parts of the ovule, than on any
ybrid descent of this species. Besides, there is no constant
elation between the number of bivalents and univalents in
ie reduction division (indicating the chromosome numbers
:⁵ the parents), which is the case in hybrids of the Drosera-
=heme (ROSENBERG 1909). This is, of course, very natural,
ι probably most species of Carica have the same chromo-
»me number. Consequently it still seems impossible to de-
de with certainty whether 0. chrysopetala and C. pentaqona
re hybrids or not, and the cause of their parthenocarpy
nst still be regarded as rather obscure. There is, there-
