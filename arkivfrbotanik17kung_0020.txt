of the sporangium. It surrounds a small eireular area, without
preserved cell walls, corresponding to the so—called plate in the
Schizaeaeeae. The annulus consists of a great number (about
25) of elongated cells. In pl. 2, fig. 5, 1116 sporangia are seen
from above, the cells of 1116 61111111118 radiating from the round

seems to be much wider than in others; this is probably
due 10 some aeeident of preservation, since the annular cells
generally leave only a small circular space in the centre.
F ig. 6 shows the sporangium from the side and the apieal po-
sition of the annulus. The sporangium in the lower part of
fig. 4, has the appearance of being preserved entire, with a
globular shape and a transverse annulus round the middle of
the sporangium instead of at the apex. Probably, however,
what is preserved is not the whole sporangium but only the
annulus, as in other cases.

In some cases it was possible 10 16111ον6 the whole eon-
tents of a sporangium more or less intaet. Three different
eountings of 1116 speres from one sporangium gave the result
417, 394, 401. This number is probably 100 small: the typieal
number may be supposed 10 be 512.

Diagrammatie drawings of the sporangium as seen from
the apex and from the side are given in text-fig. 1.

Τ116 speres are of the tetrahedral type, with a diameter
Of 0‚035——0,050 mm., generally about 02040 mm. Their surface
shows the tetrad sear and a distinet sculpture of fine dense
ridges, whieh is more prominent on 1116 side faeing outwards
in the tetrad.

As far as the sporangia of Rujsordia Go'pperti are known,
they would seem 10 agree with the idea of a sehizaeaeeous
affinity suggested by SEWARD. The sporangia are rather small
