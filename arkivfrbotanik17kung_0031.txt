HALLE, ΟΝ ΤΗΕ SPORANGIA OF SOME MESOZOIO FERNS. 23

following figures were obtaind: 70, 92, 112», 120, 125. All
these figures fall between the typical numbers 64 and 128,
and as it was very easy to separate and count the 5110105, it
is fairly certain that the number 01 5110105 111 00011 sporangium
corresponds to the typical number 01 128.

As might be expected from a comparison of the 51Ζο of the
sporangia, the Spore-output is thus much smaller in Thau-
matopteris Schenkz· than ι in Dictyophyllum erile. This ‹lif-
ference is another point in favour of keeping the two genera
separate.

Dictyophyllum, Hausmansnia and lesaaezmzatoptem are usu—
ally held to belong to a fairly natural group of Mesozoic 101115.
SEWARD refers this group to the Dipteridinae to which they
present a general resemblance of habit and in some soral 0110-
1001015. In the Dipteridinae, as in the Polypodiaceae gener-
ally, in which great family Dipteris was formerly included,
the number of spores per sporangium is very constantly 64.
In the 105511 group there is a much greater variation. Haus-
mannia Forchhammeri has the same typical number of 64
5110105, 05 111 Dipteris, or perhaps sometimes 128. In Dictyo—
phyllum erile, at the other end of the series, the spere-output
seems to correspond in most cases to a typical number of 512.
Thaumatopteris Schenki, with a probable typical number of
128, occupies an intermediate position, agreeing, however, in
regard 10 the spore-output, more closely with Hausmannia.
Of the three genera Hausmannia in other respects also, as for
instance in regard to the 5011 and the general habit, 15 the one
most closely similar to Dipteris. All three genera are roughly
contemporaneous, but Dictyophyllum 15 perhaps the oldest,
and Hausmannia certainly has its maximum development
at a later epoch than ‘the others, being particularly abundant
in the lower Cret-aceous. It 15 not suggested that the three
genera necessarily are on the ¹same line of (10500111, 11111 11 15
of some interest to note the great variation of the sporo-out—
put, as the recent Dipteridinae to which these 105511 generally
have been referred are characterized by a marked uniformity
in this respect.
