maximum length is 6 cm. The difference seems to be greater
between E. intermedius and E. Mu'nsteri than between E.
intermedius and Ε. Moberqz'i. As for the two other species,
which are nearly related to Ε. Moberqii: Ε. Lyellz‘i and Ε.
Bunbumamcs, see the pape-r by M6LLER and HALLE (1913).

Neocalamites Nathorstii sp. nov.
Pl. 1, figs. 9—14.

Stems articulate, with few branches3 internodes on the
impressions minutely striated and with 8—16 fairly distinct
longitudinal furrows3 their length about 40—70 mm, their
breadth 10-—20 mm. Nodes mostly of the same breadth as
the internodes. Leaves free down to their bases, their number
12-24, their breadth 1‚5 mm, their length in most cases more
than 50 mm.

In some pieces of rock there are found rather small and
gracile fragments of branches or stems belonging to this
species, Here the breadth of the internodes is about 2 mm
and the length 20—30 mm. The leaves are l mm broad, ¹
at least 3 cm long and standing out at right angles from
the axis.

The material of N eocalamites Nathorstz'i was collected by
Prof. NATHORs'r at Whitby, Yorkshire‚ in 1909, and by Prof.
HALLE in the same place in 1910. Through this discovery
of Prof. NATHORST’S the genus Neocalamites has been proved
to exist as late as about the middle of the Jurassie period.
The other species of the genus are from the Rhaetie (N.
hoerensis (SOHIMP.) HALLE, N. Carrerei (ZfflLL.) HALLE‚.N.
Knowltom'i BERRY) or from the Keuper (N. M eriani (Bucen.)
HALLE, N. virqiniensis (FONTAJNE) BERRY). The fossiliferous
rock is a coarse arenaceous shale, in which the impressions
are not so distinct as in the case of Equi-semes intermedius.
In the same pieces of rock are also to be found the remains
of many other plants.

Prof. HALLE has shown that in Neocalamites as well as
in some species of Equisetites from the Lower Mesozoic there
is a greater number of longitudinal furrows on the internodes
