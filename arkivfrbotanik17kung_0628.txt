the hasal portion. In certain instances setae were found
which had broken off at the place where the basal nodule
is applied to the cell wall. This breaking off of the spines‘
is not found in L. subsalsa LEMM„ L. lonqiseta (LEMM.)
PniNTz and L. cilrz'sormis (SNow) G. M. SMITH; species that
have been referred to the genus Claodatella of LEMMERMANN„
If it can be shown that the setae of all Laqerkeimia species}
with swollen bases apposed to the cell wall also break off,
readily there may be a justification for a separation into*
the two genera Laqerheimia and Chodatella, but for the pre-
sent the two are united in a single genus.

Considerable varation was also noted in the occurrence
of a pyrenoid. In a majority of individuals the pyrenoid
was lacking but in some it was very well defined.

Dactylococcopsis irregularis sp. nov. Figs. 26-28,

Cells solitary‚ free floating‚ without a gelatinous enve-
lope. Cells very narrowly acicular, with ends drawn out into
fine points, twisted to form lax spirals with two or three
turns, Cell contents homogeneous‚ pale grey-green in color.

Distance between apices 27—45 μ, diameter of cells
1-1,5 μ.

The twisting, coupled with the lack of a gelatinous en-
velope, suggests that the alga may be an Ankistrodesmue
rather than a Dactylococcopsz's species but the pale homo-
geneous grey-green color of the cell contents shows that it.
is not a member of the Chlorophyeeae.

In general shape of the cells the species is closely rela÷
ted to D. acicularz's LEMM. but it differs in the lack of a
gelatinous envelope, the solit-,ary habit, and the twisting of
the cells.
