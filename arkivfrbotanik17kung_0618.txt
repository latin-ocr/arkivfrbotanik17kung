fore, little reason to make any further comment on ERNs'r’
theory.

The embryology of C. candamarcenszs agrees in all respect
with the general scheme, outlined above for this genus. Th
reduction division in the pollen mother· cells is quite normal
(Fig. 16) Pollen- tubes are often found.

The same development is also found in 0. Papayal
which, however, is somewhat surprising, the embryology o·
that species having been studied by other investigators wit}
other results. According to USTERI (1907) and ΚΒΑΤΖΕε
(1918) tetrads are found with three or four cells,of whic}
one developes into the embryo-sac. USTERI’s data are rathei
vague but KRA'rzEn’s seem to be accurate, for which reasor
it may be inferred that different races of papaya behave ir
a different manner. Moreover KRATZER reports norma
embryo-sacs‚ whereas USTERI says that antipodals are de
veloped but seldom. pollen-tubes could not be found b)
Us‘rssssr in his material, but probably the ovules investigate(
were too young. Ι have seen them several times, as has alst
KRATZER. The reduction division in the pollen mother-cella
is normal and I have also seen a quite normal diakinesis ir
an embryo-sac mother-cell (Fig. 17 ). Hence USTERI’s assump
tion that· the seeds of papaya develop parthenogenetically iz
erroneous, especially as his own attempts to prove the par.
thenogenesis experimentally were not successful. On th«
other hand, it- is certain that parthenocarpy occurs in tbi:
species tou, as stated by Usrmzr and ΚΒΑΤΖΕΒ, though i
must be a rare event. I myself have never seen any seedleti
fruits of papaya. l

1) Two Ecuadorian species of Carica with edible fru'
—— Ο. chrysopetaza and Ο. pentayona — are described as n

2) The embryo-sac of these species and of 0. Papa
is described as being of Linum-type, though only with
nuclei. Antipodals are lacking.
