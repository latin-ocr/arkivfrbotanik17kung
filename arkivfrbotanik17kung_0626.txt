the method of reproduction were very rare but instances
were observed where there had been a division of the cell
contents into two parts and into four parts. In one of the
latter there was a dark refractive body that suggests very
much an eye-spot (fig. 6). It seems probable‚ therefore, that
reproduction is by zoosporcs, although the evidence is by no
means conclusive.

Since the method of reproduction is in doubt the syste-
matic position of the alga is also uncertain. Assuming that
reproduction is by zoospores the alga should be placed in
the Palmellaceae. If this is the case it is the first member
of the family with the gelatinous envelope forming setae.
The breaking of the cell wall into two parts at the time of
reproduction is a feature that is frequently found in the
Palmellaoeae, whereas in the Autosporaceae there is usually
a slit-likc opening for the liberation of the new plants.

The genus is dedicated to the well known student ofl
the freshwater algae, Dr. o. BORGE of stookholm. ¹

Schizochlamys solitaria sp. nov. Figs. 11—16.

Cells solitary, free floating, enveloped in a wide hyaline
homogeneous spherical gelatinous sheath. Cells spherical,
with a single cup-shaped chloroplast that contains one py-
renoid. Cell wall smooth, with a single thickened nodule
that usually lies opposite the apex of the. chloroplast. Cell
division usually into two daughter cells that are liberated
through a pore in the old mother cell wall.

Diameter of cells without gelatinous envelope 5,5—8‚5 μ,
with envelope 15-25 μ.

The association of the ‚old cell wall with the new cells
shows that the alga belongs to Schizochlamys. The behavior
of the wall at the time of reproduction resembles S. deli-
catula W. WEST where the wall remains entire, instead of
S. yelatinosa A. BR. where the wall breaks into two or four
pleceS. ·

The species differs from the other members of the genus
in the solitary habit of the cells and the peculiar nodule on
the cell walls. This nodule is usually opposite the apex of
