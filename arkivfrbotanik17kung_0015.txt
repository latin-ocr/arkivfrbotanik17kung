is ever perforated at the apex. The cells 01 1116 sporangial wall
can be fairly clearly seen 011 using a high power preparation
lens (compare pl. 1, 1183. 5, 6). They appear to be uniform all
over the sporangium: there cannot be observed any differentia-

is possible that there may be a zone 01 66113 with thickened
walls, as in Anqiopteris, but no trace thereos 6611 be detected,
even on the most 66161111 examination.

In 13116 specimens in figs. 5 and 6, there is seen along one
side of the sporangia a 11116 but distinct longitudinal furrow,
running from 13116 apex to the base. This line evidently marks
the stomium or the place 01 1161113661166. Ι11 611011161 specimen,
pl. 1, 118. 3, of which a part is shown in higher magnification
in pl. l, 118. 12, 1116 sporangia seem to have reached a later
state 01 development. They are open, and in some places show
a longitudinal sh‘t corresponding to the stomium.

The exact arrangement 01 1116 sporangia is somewhat
obscured on account 01 111611 crowded position. The rows
01 31101611816 appear all 11111101111, but on a 66161111 examination
they are found 10 be arranged two and two (compare pl. 1,

Usually the sporangia, cover the lower 31111666 01 1116 11111116
entirely, so that the veins cannot be observed. From the an-
alogy with recent Marattiaceae it would seem probable that
the sori were placed over the veins. The relation between the
sori and the veins, however, is more complicated in this plant.
