HALLE, ΟΝ ΤΗΕ SPORANGIA OF SOME MESOZOIC FERNS. 15

scribed in some detail, opinions still diverge regarding the sys-
tematic position of the genus.

The first important contribution to the knowledge of the
sporangia and the affinities of the genus was given by Gor-
PERT (1841, Lief. 1—2, p. 2) in his description of the species
Thaumatopteris Munsteri GOPP„ which was later transferred
to Dictyophyllum by NATHORST (1876, p. 24 and foll.). Gor-
PERT's own words may be quoted: »Die Sporangien sind gros-
ser, als ich sie irgend bei den Polypodiaceen der Jetztwelt
gesehen habe und n‘ahern sich in dieser Beziehung den Cya-
theaceen, mit den sie auch riicksichtlich des completten Ringes
verwandt erscheinen». GOPPERT'S figure (pl. 2, fig. 6) in-
deed shows a very distinct complete annulus in several of
the sporangia figured, but the figure gives the impression
of being somewhat diagrammatic.

The idea of a close relationship to the Cyatheaceae was
favoured also by SOHENK (1867, p. 71), who states that the
type is more closely related to the Cyatheaceae than to the
»Acrostichaceae». In his »Fossile Pflanzenreste»‚ however,
SCHENK (1888, p. 37) speaks of Dictyophyllum and allied
genera as occupying an intermediate position between the
Gleicheniaceae and the Cyatheaceae and also remarks on the
resemblance to Maionia. POTONIE': in his »Lehrbuch» (1899,
p. 88) refers Dictyophyllum and allied genera to the Cyathea-
ceae, but remarks that this genus and some others allied to
it are perhaps better treated as a separate group intermediate
between the Cyatheaceae 'and the Gleicheniaceae in accordance
with the opinion already expressed by SCHENK. In his treat-
ment of the fossil ferns in ENGLEB, δι PRAN'rL's »Natiirliche
Pssanzenfamssien», however, Po'romi] (1902, p. 349) ranges
Dictyophyllum, Olathropteris and Camptopteris as well as Lac·
coplkris under the Matoniaceae.

As early as 1828, BRONGNIART (1828, p. 62) remarked
on the resemblance to the Polypodiaceae shown by the closely
related Clathropteris, and several of the following writers
expressed similar opinions regarding Dictyopkyllum. SAPORTA

ᾗ brought these and other related genera to a separate group‚

which he called the »Proto-Polypodiees» (SAPORTA δι MARION,

. 1881, . 167).

l Zigmm in 1882 (p. 17) drew attention to the resemblance
of the allied genus Clathropteris to Dipteris, which was at that
