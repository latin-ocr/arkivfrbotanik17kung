ason the sporangia of some Mesozcic ferus,

Communicated June 2nd 1920 by A. G. NA‘rHoRstr and C. LINDMAN.

During the course of other palaeobotanical work I have
made some observations on a few specimens of fertile Meso-
zoic ferns among the collections of the Palaeobotanical Depart-
ment of the State Museum of Natural History at Stockholm.
Recent publications on some Mesozoic forms generally sup-
posed to belong to the Dipteridinae suggested an extension
of these studies to species of the genera Dictyophyllum, Haus-
mannia, and Thaumatopteris. Especially through the work
nof Bowfflz, the amount of the output of spores per sporangium
has assumed a greater significance than before, and it would

ἰ seem to be of some interest to consider this feature in fossil
ferns. In favourable cases, the number of spores may be
counted almost as easily and exactly in fossil material as in ,
living ferns, and, especially in the Dictyophyllum-Hausmannia
group, the spore-output seems to offer a character of some
:importance for the discussion of the systematical position of
&e fossil genera.

for a fertile Rhaetic fern believed to be identical with the
sterile fronds first described by JAEGER (1827, p. 28; pl. 5,
‘fig. 5) as Mar-anteidea arenacea and afterwards named by
szsn (1838, p. 139) Taeniopteris marantacea. KRASSER
