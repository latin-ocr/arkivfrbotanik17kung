Ο. HEILBORN, CYTOLOGICAL STUDIES ΟΝ CARICA. 7

›ther‚ unknown species. We shall return to this subject
¹ater on.

As indicated above, I have never seen any male indivi-
iuals or male flowers of Ο. chrysopetala and O. penlaqona.
'several persons whom I consulted during my journey told
me they had made the same experience and JAMESON (1865)
nentions, though he does not describe, two cultivated spe—
=ies of Carica, of which he had never seen any male indivi-
1uals. The male plants of Ο. chrysopetala and C. pentaqoua
tre obviously extremely rare if they do exist at all. Both
species are propagated in the gardens in Ecuador by means
>f cuttings.

It appears from the preceding account that the word
›chamburo» is used in a different sense in different parts of
fficuador. Indeed, SPRUCE (1869) tells us that, throughout
÷he Andes, all the larger species of Carica are called »cham-
›uro›> and the smaller ones »col del monte» (›>wood-cabbage›>).
[n this connection an error of WOLF (1892, p. 443) should
>e corrected. According to this writer the cultivated »cham-
mro» of the Ecuadorian mountains is C. diqitata. This is a
›eculiar mistake. 0. diqitata is merely a synonym for Jaca-
’alia diqz‘tata (Ponrmo) SOLMs, which is a spiny trec from
:he upper Amazon basin. This species too is called »cham-
buro» by the natives, but obviously it has nothing to do with
:he Ecuadorian garden-Oaricas.

Unfortunately I did not know during my journey how
very scanty our knowledge is of these Andean fruit-trees.
Jtherwise I should have paid them more attention and
t'ormed more complete collectione. Species and races, un-
mown to science‚ may probably still be found in the gar-
iens of the natives.

Ο. Papaya L.

The common papaya is cultivated only in the tropical
‚owlands and on the lowest slopes of the mountains. At
[engueL south of Guayaquil, a race called ›>papaya del
mico» (omonkey’s papaya») was found growing at the skirts
>f the woods and was said to be wild. It differed in no
,asential feature, however, from the typical papaya and had, .
po doubt, escaped from the gardens.
