ERDTMAN, Two NEW SPECIES OF MESOZOIC EQUISETALES. 3

Ε. Milnsteri STERNB.‚ which is not among the largest species
of the genus. Only in one case have internodes of thelength
of 6 cm been measured3 the ordinary length seems to be
4——5 cm, with the exception of shoots not quite grown to
full size on which internodes measuring only 2-3 cm in
length have been found. As appears from the figures (1,2,
4, 5), the impressions of the stem show a distinct striation.
The internodes would thus seem to have been provided with
distinct furrows (Ξ the ridges on the impressions)‚ which is
one of the differences between this species and the one that
is probably most closely related: Ε. Moberqii MoLL. The
nodes have the same thickness as the internodes3 the few
diaphragms which are to be found in the material are in a
very bad state of preservation.

Fig. 8 shows the impression of a spore—bearing cone and
fig. 6 probably a rhizome-impression‚ differing from the im-
pressions of the aerial stems through the rough and more
irregularly striated surface. A tuber is shown in fig. 7.
Fig. 2 (²l1) gives a good idea of the form of the leaf-teeth,
as shown by the impression, and fig. 4 shows the carbonized
substance of the leaf-teeth. It is worthy of remark that
the number of the teeth is the same as the number of the
furrows of the stem, which is also the case with the recent
Equiselaceoe. The present species is the first one of the genus
Equisetites in which this case has been stated.

The two species to which Ε. intermedius appears to be
most closely related are Ε. Mimsteri STERNB. (Rhaetic) and
Ε. Moberqii Mem. (Liassic or younger, Kurremolla in Scania).
Ε. Μἰῖηειενί is the largest of these three species. The breadth
of the stem is here 10—15 mm on the impressions‚ or some-
times even more than 20 mm. The stem of Ε. intermedius
measures 8 mm (4—-12 mm) and that of Ε. Moberqii 4—7 mm
in breadth. The number of the leaf-teeth of the three species
is, as it were, inversely proportional to the breadth of the
stem; the one with the narrowest stems — Ε. Moberqii —
has 16-20 leaf-teeth, Ε. intermedius 16 (12—18) and Ε.
Μ’ἰὶηειενί 12 (10-14). Ε. Mimsteri has the thickest and most
distinctly furrowed internodes; those of Ε. Moberqii are very
slender, very little or not at all furrowed, and measure at
most 8 cm in length. Ε. intermedius is intermediate in these
respectas, with narmw, distinctly furrowed internodes, whose
