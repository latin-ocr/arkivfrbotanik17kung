HEILBORN, CYTOLOGY OF ANANAS SATIVUS LINDL. 5

It is thus evident that- the different ras-es of Anonos
ativus must be of very different cytological constitution.
?uture investigations will probably reveal among these races
»series of multiple chromosome numbers like those already
eund in many genera and, in addition, hybrids such as our
3afios-race. Probably there will be found within this species
:bromosome relations similar to those known to exist within
¹he genus Rosa (TACKHOLM 1920, BLmKBURN and HARRISON
921). It is now important to realize that races of our
{anos-type are probably hybrids between other Ammas sativus-
aces, whereas races of our Tenguel-type are, apparently, no
iybrids at all. Hence the present writer finds it very un-
ikely that the species as a whole should be of hybrid origin.

It. appears from the foregoing that both the Tenguel-race
md the Banos-race are parthenocarpic. Hence it is clear
hat also races with good pollen — and thus, apparently,
iot of hybrid origin — may produce seedless fruits We
nay thus stat-e that, on account of its reduction division,
{nanas sativae cannot be cited as a proof of the hybrid-
.ypothesis of parthenocarpy. The question of the origin
*f Ananas satit-us may, perhaps, be settled with certainty,
rhen a great many of its cultivated races have been
nvestigated cytologically. It should, however. be pointed
lut at once that Ananas sativus is a species unusually well
ited for studies on the origin of parthenocarpy, as it con-
ts of both races with good and with bad pollen.

Again, it appears from the works of TlsOHLER and
'ANGREMOND that all races of edible bananas (Musa sapi-
um) hitherto investigated have irregular reduction division
nd may thus be regarded as hybrids, whereas several other
ecies of Musa have been found to have normal reduction.
he edible bananas are parthenocarpic, the others are fertile. ’
ence it seems evident that the parthenocarpy in Musa sapien-
m must be of hybrid origin, although the details of the re-
uction division in that species are not yet fully worked out.
s to Carica, the writer (1921) has recently pointed out the
ifficulty of drawing any decisive conclusions from cytological
systematical studies. It could not be decide-d if the

  
   
  
    
     
   

rthenocarpic species of Carica really arc hybrids, though
at possibility is certainly not excluded.
