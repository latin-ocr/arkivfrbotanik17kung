Colombiau G. cundinamarcensis has never been described,
and I have not seen any specimenS. Hence it seems clear
that we must call the Ecuadorian species C. candamarcensis
HooK„ though I am not convinced that the name is suitable
in point of language (Jand geography!).

To sum up: SOL-MS in his monographs(1889, 1893) speaks
of a monoecious C. cundinamarcensis Hoox„ native of Ecuass
dor, which belongs to sect. Vasconcellea. But the truth is„
that the Ecuadorian species should bc called G. canda-
marcensz‘s HOOK. which is dioecious and belongs to sect. He-
mv'papaya. What the Colombian C. cundinamarcensis re-
ally is, can only be determined by a study of it in its nav
tive country, as the European greenhouse-specimens with
that name are nowadays certainly of doubtful origin.

 

Returnin'g now to the two parthenocarpic species, de-
scribed above, it may be asked whether they can be found
growing wild anywhere or whether they are products of old
indian gardening. If the latter should be the case, the hy-
pothesis may well be adopted that both have arisen by
means of crossing between some other, wild species. However,
it must be state-d at once that from taxonomical studies-
no positive evidence can be adduced in favour of such a
hypothesis. C. pentaqona is a real Vasconcellea with 5-celled
fruit and entire stigmata3 C. ckrysopetala with 5-celled fruit
and bifid stigmata belongs to sect. Hemipapaya as does G.
candamarcensis. All three have tubercular seeds with a sar-
cotesta that does not fill the cavities between the pro-
tuberances, which is the case with sect. Eupapaya. Resides
the seeds are much bigger than those of C. Papaya. Thus
it is clear that C. Papaya cannot be regarded as an even-
tual parent of the two parthenocarpic species, but a certain
resemblance between those last-mentioned and O. candamar-
censis should not be overlooked, especially as regards the
shape and peculiar flavour of the fruits. The difference in
the shape of the stigmata is perhaps no valid reason to
place 0. pentaqona in another section of the genus than that
of the two other species. My opinion is, that all three are
nearly related to one another, but that there seems to
be no real ground for regarding the parthenocarpic spe-
cies as hybrid offspring of G. camiamarc-ensis and some
