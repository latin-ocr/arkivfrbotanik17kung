Danaeopsis fecunda n. sp. (Pl. 1, figs. 1—13.)

Frond pinnate3 pinnae narrowly lanceolate-linear, with
a rounded non-decurrent base, gradually tapering towards
the apex, 10 cm. long or more, at least 2,5—3 cm. broad a little
above the base. Scondary veins usually forking immediately
on leaving the midrib, distant about 1 mm. half-wayto the
margin, forking again near the margin and the branches ana-
stomosing. Fertile pinnae, with the lower side, except the
midrib, completely covered with contiguous sporangia. Each
sorus consisting of a double row os free, ellipsoidal sporangia
which have a faint longitudinal furrow marking the line os
dehiscence and a slight rounded depression at the apex3 di-
mensions of sporangia O,80—O,90><O,65——O,75 mm.

The best specimen is the fertile pinna shown in pl. l,
fig. 2. Only the upper part is preserved, the broken lower
end having a breadth of 3 cm. The specimen consists of an
impression of the upper side, the midrib occurring as a slightly

⁰ depressed band, 2—3 mm. broad, covered with a dark fflm of

carbonaceous matter. With the exception of the midrib, the
whole surface of the impression is completely covered with
the carbonized remains of the sporangia. These are very
well preserved, with the outward shape but little altered.
They are so closely packed that both the sporangia of each
row and those of different rows are in close touch with one
another, the sporangia being in fact often compressed through
want of space (pl. l, fig. 4).

The individua] sporangia are ellipsoidal, but often appear
shorter than they are, because they have been compressed
parallel to the longer diameter. Though the sporangia are
very closely packed, they are not fused to form synangia‚ but
are free from each other right down to their bases. This is seen
on another, more fragmentary, specimen, of which a photograph
is reproduced in pl. l, fig. 13. In this specimen the sporangia
themselves have disappeared with the exception of their bases
which appear as dark rings on the lighter suriace of the rock.

' In some places it can be seen that each ring has a complete

unbroken outline distinct from those of adjacent sporangia.

At the apex of each sporangium there is a slight rounded
depression, not very sharply circumscribed but always distinct.
It is no doubt this hollow that has been taken for a pore by
