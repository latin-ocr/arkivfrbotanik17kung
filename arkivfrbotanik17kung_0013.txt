SOLMS LAUBAOH (1887, p. 153) points out that new exami-
nation is wanted to decide whether Danaeojpsis marantacea
should be brought to the Danaeaceae. He states that the sori
01 the fossil form agree fairly well with those 01 Danaea, and
that, according to SOHIMPER'S figures, they seem to open by
pores, but that it is doubtful whether the sporaniga are fused
or not.

ΡοΤοΝΙΙῖ] (1899, p. 90) mentions Danaeopsis as agreeing
closely with Danaea in respect to the sori and sporangia.

LEUTHARDT (1904, p. 29), who described new material
01 Danaeopsis marantacea, confirms the statement that the
sporangia are fused to form synangia which open by pores.

KRASSER places his Pseudodanaeopsis under the subordo
Danaea which is characterized by the fusion 01 the sporangia
into synangia which open through apical pores. He com-
municates, however, STUR's diagnose 01 the 11110 material
from Lunz which KRASSER identifies with Ps. plana (EMMONs)
FONT. (= Ps. reticulata FONT.); and this diagnose gives a
different interpretation 01 the soral structure: »Sporangia
0.7 mm circiter longa, ovalia, basi latiora, apice acutiora,
oculo inermi laevia armato autem reticulata, rima extrorsa
dehiscentia, libera et basi tantum in receptaculo licet nervo
sesama, seriata, et quidem in series duas, nervo fertili per
totam ejus longitudinem oppositas cum eodem parallelas
coordinata ».

It will be apparent from this short summary 01 the dif-
ferent opinions that the structure of the sori and sporangia
01 Danaeopsis and its relation to the recent genera of marat-
tiaceous ferns are by 110 means clear. In 1911 Ι found at the
Rhaetic ocal-mines 01 BiUesholm in Scania several specimens
of a Danaeopsis and among them a fine fertile pinna. This
specimen shows the sporangia with unusual clearness. It
belongs to a new species, which I have called D. secunda on
account 01 the abundant productiori 01 large sporangia.
