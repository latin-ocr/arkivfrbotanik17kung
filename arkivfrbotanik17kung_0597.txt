Notes on the cytology of Ananas sativus Lindl.
and the origin of its parthenocarpy.

In his book on crossing as the cause of apogamy in the
vegetable· kingdom ERNST (1918) also devotes a chapter to
a, discussion of the origin of parthenocarpy. He there ex-
presses the opinion that parthenocarpic cultivated plants
most probably must be of hybrid origin, as the degeneration
phenomena‚ found in their ovules and anthers, show a certain
resemblance to those of sterile hybrids. Conclusions. drawn
from such compar-isone, are, however, rather uncertain‚espe—
cially if they are not completed by cytological studies on
chromosome numbers and reduction division. Of partheno—
carpic species and races, only the edible bananas, Musa
sapientum, have as yet been studied cytologically from this
point of view (TlsenLER 1910, D’ANGREMOND 1914) as well as
some species of Carica, recently investigated by the present
,writer (HntnBORN 1921). Consequently our knowledge of
this problem is still very incomplete‚ especially as the works
just mentioned do not arrive at quite conclusive results.
Further studies are thus desirable.

3 Ananas eatzvus is an almost totally parthenocarpic species.
§According to WEBBER (1900) it is very seldom that a perfect
lpeed is found in the fruits that reach the American markets
