HALLE, ΟΝ THE SPORANGIA OF sOME MESO'AOIC FERNS. 17

show some of the best examples. The annulus (tonsis-ts ot'
about 30 cells on an average. 11 appears to 00111111116 611 round
1116 sporangium, which in the speeimens figurcd has a fairly
regular circular outline in its flattened state. On a closer
examination‚ however, it is seen that the annulus is not con-
tinueus but open at one place. In figs. 14-16 the gap is
in the lower parts of the figures. At the break the two ends
come very close 10 66011 011161, 01· even overlap, but they do not
meet and clearly lie in different planes. This feature is not
very well shown in the photographs, but in the actual spe-
eimens it 0611 116 clearly observed by changing the focussing.

The annulus is thus incomplete and twistesL but continues
111-6611061117 611 round the sporangium. It is probably this
feature that has caused the difference of opinion as to whether
the ‘annulus is complete 01· incomplete. Owing to its sinuous
course it is very rar'ely that the whole annulus can be seen
from one side.

The sporangia that show the whole annulus have always
a circular outline and it may be inferred from this that the
original shape of the sporangium was either globular or 1611-
ticular. When the sporangium is seen parallel to the plane
of the annulus, it is found to be only a little broader than the
latter; and it is therefore more probable that 1116 6611161 shape
was lenticular rat-her than globular. There is 110 11606 of a
stalk, and it is impossible to make out 1116 orientation of the
annulus in respect to the apex and the base of the sporangium.
It would seem probable that the annulus was more 01· less
verticaL but there is no direct information on this point.

The sporangia of Dictyophyllum are strikingly large 111
comparison with those of the recent ferus with which it* has
been compared. Ι have found the diameter of the annulus
to be 0,5—O‚6 mm. NATHosss‘r gives the size of the sporangia
as 0,4’--Ο,6 111111. The sporangia of Dipteris are stated by
SEWARD & DALE (1901, p. 500) 10 measure O,02 mm. in length.
This figure quoted also by NATHORST (1906, p. 19) is evidently
a misprint for 0‚2 mm. Yet the differenee between Dictyn-
phyllum and Dipteriss 111 this respect is considerable and sug-
gested 611 examination of the spere-output per spei-angium
in Dictyophyllum. The sporangia can be easily removed 111-
dividually from the matrix. On treatment with Sentmrzm’s
mixture and ammonia the speres of each sporangium usually
