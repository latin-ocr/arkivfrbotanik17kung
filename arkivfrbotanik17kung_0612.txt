Carica cannot be regarded as a well-known genus. SOLMs
in his monograph 1893 knew but 21 speeies, besides some
rather doubtful, imperfectly described ones. Since then,
very few new species have been described —in South Ame—
rica only two, viz.

C. bolivz'ana RUSBY, Bull. New York Bot. Gard. IV, 1907
and C. triplisecta HERZOG, Meded. Rijks-Herb. 27, 1915, both

from Bolivia.

In addition, there are two species described from the
west Indies, viz.

C. y'amaz'censis URB. Symb. Antill. VI, 1909
and G. portoricen-sis URB. l. c, IV, 1910.

One species with very peculiar, five-horned fruits has
been discovered in Callifornia.

0. caudata BRANDEGEE, Zoe IV, 1894.

C. tunarz’ensis O. ΚΤΖΕ, Rev. III (2) 101 is no Carica
but of doubtful systematic position and Ο. dolichaula D.
SMITH, Bot. Gaz. XXIII, 1897 should rather be referred ta,
the genus Jacaratia. ἵ

It is possible that still some more species may havd

 

been described from the West Indies, Central America or·
Mexico during the last few years but I do not think so.=
Consequently we may state now, when concluding this chap-
ter, that as yet 28 species of Carica are known to science‚·
but according to travellers' reports many new ones — from
the Andean countries especially —- still remain to be de
scribed.

Gytology and embryology.

The material for the cytolog'ical investigat-‚ion was fixed
partly in ZENKER’s‚ partly in FLEMMING’s and partly in
CARNOY’S liquid. After washing it was preserved in 70 56⁴
alcohol during the whole journey and imbedded in paraffine‘v
after my return to Stockholm. The ZENKER-fixed materia}
proved to be excellent: hence that fixing-fluid may be r “’
commended for Carica. · “
