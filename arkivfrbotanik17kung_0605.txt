During a journey in Ecuador 1919—1920 Ι collected ma-
³rial for a cytological study of some parthenocarpic fruits.
[y attention was especially attracted by two parthenocarpic
oecies of Carica that are cultivated in the valleys of the
:cuadorian Andes. When, after returning home, I tried to
lentify these specieS, Ι was rather surprised to find that
aey have not yet been described in scientific literature. A
escription of them is thus necessary before entering upon
:e cytological part of this work. Besides these two species
have also made a study on Ο. candamarcensis ΗοοΚ. and

¹. Papaya L.. both ofv which are common fruit-trees in
