from the Bahamas, West-Indies and Florida. I myself canno
remember having ever seen any seeds in pine—apples. O
this species I have made some cytological observations which,
though very fragmentary‚ may be of some importance fo
the solution ot' the problem referred to above. The materia
for my investigation was collected in Ecuador where several
races of Anamis sativus are cultivated, though I do not know
their horticultural or vulgar names. Two races were fixed,
one at Tenguel on the coastal lowland, south of Guayaquil,
and the other at the village of 133ᾗο0 at a height of 1800
m.‚ in the valley of Pastaza. They will be referred to in
this work as the Tenguel-race and the Banos-race resp. Both
anmmo's, ZENKER’s and CARNOY'S liquids were tried, but
only the one last-mentioned gave satisfactory results.

The material of the Tenguel-race proved to be too old,
the reduction division in the pollen mother-cells having
already been carried out. All the tetrads formed are, how-
ever, quite normal (Fig. 4), indicating that the meiosis too
has been normal, without any irregularities whatever. The
pollen-grains contain much plasma and are apparently capable}
of germination. I have not been able to determine thei
somatic chromosome number.

In the Bafios-race the reduction division was found}
to be much delayed as compared with the Tenguel-race. Buds
of equal size contain pollen tetrads in the case of the latter,
but only mother-cells in early prophase in that of the former.
I do not know if this slow development is due to the colder
climate at Banos, or to some germinal quality of the race.
Perhaps, it depends on disturbances brought about by de-
fective chromosome conjugation, or on some other factor
connected with the irregular meiosis that takes place.

In the heterotypic metaphases a great many chromosomes
are found, and both bivalents and univalents 0311
110 distinguished (Figs. 1, 2). Τ110 former are dumbbell-shaped
and arranged to an equatorial plate, the latter are spherical
and partly scattered irregularly in the spindle outside the
plate. Hence the aspect of the metaphases is just that which
characterizes many hybrids. Unfortunately‚ the chromosomes
are so numerous and so minute as to make an exact counting
impossible, but from several metaphases the number of
bivalents could approximately be estimated at 25—30 and3
