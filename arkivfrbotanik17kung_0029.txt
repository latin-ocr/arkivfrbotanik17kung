HALLE, ON THE SPORANGIA or som: Msssozom urens. 21

whether it was complete or not. The annulus seems to have
been somewhat twisted. as in Dictyophyllum, and probably it
was of the same general type as in that genus. The number
of cells in the preserved part of the annulus is about 10-12
in the semicircle.

It is possible to remove the sporangia from the rock, but
on account· of their crowded position in the sori, it is very
difficult to isolate single sporangia from the rest. In a few
cases, however, this was possible, and the spores of each spor-
angium could then be counted after the usual treatment with
SCHULTZE’s mixture and ammonia. Unfortunately the spores
cannot always be separated from each other but partly remain
packed in dense clusters which renders the counting very
difficult. The figures are therefore not very accurate, yet they
may be held to give a general idea of the spore-output. As the
result of a counting of the spores in four sporangia the following
figures were obtained: 42, 52, 57, 99. The typica] number of
speres in each sporangium would thus seem to be 64 to 128. It
is possible that the high figure of 99 which was found in one
case may be due to a superimposition of two sporangia. In
order to decide on this point, it would have been desirable to
count the contents of a greater number of sporangia, but it·
was not possible to isolate any more sporangia intact.

The difference, in regard to the number of spores in each
spor-angium, between Dictyophyllum exile and Hausmanm'a
Forclthammeri is considerable. The number of spores in
Dictyophyllum exile (see above, p. 18) was found to corres-
pond in most cases to the typical number of 512, in Haus-
mannia Farchkammeri in three cases to 64, in one to 128. The
spere-output per sporangium in Hausmamzia Forchhammeri is
well in accord with the idea that Hausmannia should be held
to be most closely related to the Dipteridinae. As far as our
present knowledge of Hausmannia extends, there is nothing to
prevent this genus being actually referred to the Dipteridinae,
except, perhaps, that the sporangia seem to be a little moro
rounded.
