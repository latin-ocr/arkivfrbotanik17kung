can be judged in their flattened state, are larger than those 01
Anqiopteris. It may be that the sporangial wal] is thicker in
Da‘naeopsis and thus the actual capacity of the sporangium
smaller.

From the above description of the Scanian specimens of
Danaeopsis secunda and a comparative study of D. marantacea,
it is evident that the usual comparison of Danaeopsis with
the recent genus Danaea is entirely unwarranted. The spor-
angia are not fused to form synangia and do not open by
poreS. [STUR, in the diagnose published by KRASSER (see
above, p. 5), alone among all authors who have dealt with
this subject, gives the right interpretation of the soral struc-
ture.] The sporangia are separate and open by longitudinal
slits as in Anqiopteris and Archanyiopteris. The resemblance
to Archanqiopteris is considerably the greater one, this genus
having more elongated sori than Anqiopteris. In Danaeopsis
the sori are still longer than in Archanyiopteris, running the
whole length from the midrib to the margin. If these forms
are really on the same line 01 (10500111, their respective geolog-
ical age would seem to be rather more consistent with a short-
ening of the sorus than With its elongation during the course
of (10500111.

Ruffordia (DUNK.) SEW.

The characteristic Wealden plant Sphenopteris Geipperti
DUNK. has been shown by Prof. SEWARD (1894, p. 76) to have
a characteristic type of fertile pinnae very different from the
sterile ones. On account of this character SEWARD refers the
species to a separate genus, Rusjordia.

Fertile fronds of Rujsordia resemble those 01 501110 species
01 the recent genus Aneimia, and SEWARD therefore doubt-
fully referred Rujjordia to the Schizaeaceae (SEWARD 1. 0.
and 1910, p. 350). Later on, SEWARD (1913, p. 91, text-fig.
2 A.) discovered the spores of Rujjordia Go’pperti in a specimen
from the Wealden of Hastings. The spores were found to be
characterized by the presence of numerous ridges. This
structure recalls a characteristic feature of the spores of many
members of recent Schizaeaceae and thus supports the idea
that Rusjordia is a member 01 that family.
