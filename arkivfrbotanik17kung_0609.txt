ῑὴθεθ female flowers. His type specimen was obviously a
nale one with occasional female (Queryt hermaphrodite)
ilowersr such as are common in O. papaya and occur in this
ipeoies too. What HooKER did not know, however, was that
nost of the fruit-carrying individuals that are found in
ihe Ecuadorian mountains are purely female. There are, he-
tides, plenty of (preponderatingly) male individuals which
produce fruit but seldom. G. candamarcensz's is normally
lioeeious.

HOOKER’s type specimen was derived from seeds sent
''rom Quito to England by JAMESON. Hence we know with
=ertainty that it was of Ecuadorian origin. In Ecuador C.
undamarcensis is very common in the gardens and near the

Pastaza it is called ›>chamburo» but in the neighbourhood

There is another Carica, called cumlinamarcensis, seeds
»f which were originally introduced into Europe from Co-
{ombia by LINDEN (catalogue 1869, 1871). It has been re-
garded as identieal with O. &inclamarem-sis, e. g. by Sonus,
who even cites Ο. cundinamarce‘nsis HooKER‚ which is some-
vhat incorrect. Sonus refers the species to the section Vas-
lancellaa (fruit 5-celled‚ stigmata entire). The Ecuadorian
U. candamarcemw, however, must be referred to the section
Hemipapaya, as it has 5-celled fruits and bifid stigmata.
