HALLE, on THE SPORANGIA OF SOME MEsozom FERNs. 11

Finally Prof. SEWARD (1914, p. 135) has published some
information received from the present writer regarding the
discovery of the sporangia of Rujsordia. The observations on
which this statement was founded have never been published:
the material will be described here.

Ruffordia Gopperti (DUNK.) sz. (Pl. 2, figS. 1—8;
text-fig. 1.)

The material to be described belongs to a collection made
in Russian Manchuria, near the village of Konstantinovskaja
in the Ussuri district, by Mr. M. IVANOFF of the Comite geo-
logique of Petrograd. In the same locality are found both
sterile and fertile specimens.

A sterile specimen is shown in pl. 2, fig. 1. It agrees
well with typical fronds of Sphenopteris Go'pperti as figured by
SEWABD (1894, pl. 43 pl. 5, fig. 1.) and by others.

Fertile specimens are represented in pl. 2, figs. 2—3.
The habit is best shown by the frond in fig. 2. As in the ma-
terial examined by SEWARD, the fertile fronds or pinnae dif-
fer much from the sterile ones. The fertile fronds are at least
tri-pinnate, like the latter, but the segments are much shorter
and more widely outspread. Thus the fertile fronds do not
have the characteristic pseudo-palmate habit of the sterile
specimens. The margin of the pinnules is more or less un-
dulating and has a general appearance of crispness. In the
fertile parts, the laminae are evidently reduced, but the re-
duction has not so much affected the breadth of the pinnae
or pinnules as their length.

The specimen shown in pl. 2, fig. 3, is very indistinct,
but is no doubt specifically identical. It is this specimen that
shows the sporangia most distinctly.

The exact arrangement of the sporangia cannot be ob-
served. They do not appear to be placed in distinct sori, but
to be scattered all over the surface of the fertile pinnule (fig.
4). Their shape is never clearly shown: only the annulus is
quite distinct, with a diameter of 0,25-0,30 mm. On the
whole, the mode of preservation recalls that of some sporangia
of Klukia exilis (PHILL.) RAOIB. figured by SEWARD (1910,
p. 348, fig. 259).

The annulus is evidently transverse, placed at the apex
