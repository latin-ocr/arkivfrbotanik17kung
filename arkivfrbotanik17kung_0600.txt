six of them, 75 chromosomes could be easily counted3 in
the sixth only 74 could be found, the missing one being
probably hidden by one of the others. Hence we can state
with absolute certainty that the somatic chromosome
number in the Bafios-race is 75. Obviously‚ this
raee is highly polyploid, and we may conclude that the
bivalents and univalents of the heterotypic division should

be found in numbers that represent multiples of a funda-
mental chromosome number. From this and from the count-
ings‚ actually made in the pollen mother-cells, only one
combination seems conceivable, viZ. 30 bivalents and 15 uni.-
valents. Small irregularities,dependant on varying conjugation‚
may perhaps occur (e. g. 29 biv. and 17 univ. etc.), but still
we are certainly justified in concluding that this Ammae-
raee must be a hybrid between two other raoes
with 30 and 45 as haploid chromosome numbers,
The fundamental number of the genus is probably 15 or 5.
