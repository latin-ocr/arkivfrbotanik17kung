C'. pentayona is called ›>babaco›> by the natives and ἰε
regarded as a great delicacy. It is common in the valleys
of Pastaza and Ambato. Ι have also found it in a convent·
garden at Quito (2‚850 m) but the elimate of this locality
was obviously too colel, for the trees did not produce fruit
of good quality. Hence the limits of altitude may be esti-
mated at 1,5ΟΟ and 2500 m resp. Type specimens from
Quito. The photograph on Pl. I shows an individual from
Bafios. Ι did not preserve any flowers from the latter lo-
cality but undoubtedly they were identical with those from
Quito.

This is a very characteristic species with sulcate fruits
that very much resemble the fruits of Theobroma Cacaa„
though they are smaller. According to HOOKER the pulp is¹
yellow, but I have always found it whitish (this differenee
does not seem to be of any great importance, however)
The fruit contains plenty of tubercular seeds. The uppe1
part of the stem, the petioles, the under side of the leaves
the inflorescences and the outside of the petals are coveret
with a soft pubescence. The tree is 3-—5 m high and ofte1
branched.

HooKER’s description, as well as the coloured plate
accompanying his work, is in one respect incomplete, viz.
as regards the female flowers. Unfortunately, I have not'i1
my collection preserved more than one female flower, which
however, is reproduced in Fig. 3. The sepals of this flowe
are about 2 mm long, oblong, acuminate. The petals ari
oblong-lanoeolate, contracted above the middle to a lineat
revolute end which is straight (not bent upwards) and oft
yellowish-green colour. The ovary is ovate, acuminate and
carries five linear stigmata with bifid ends. l

HOOKER described his plant as monoecious with the ten
minal flower of the inflorescenses often female and the otha
ones male, though he did not, as mentioned above, describ·
