HALLE, ΟΝ THE SPORANGIA OF SOME MESOZOIC FERNS. 13

as compared with those of recent forms of the family but of
about the same size as those of the Jurassic genus Klukia
(cfr. SEWARD 1910, p. 348, fig. 259). Though only the an-
nulus itself is distinctly preserved, there seems to be suffi-
cient evidence that it was apioal, with radiating cells surround-
ing a »plate», where the wall was more delicate and has not
been preserved. The striation of the spores, too, as SEWARD
has pointed out, recalls a characteristic feature of the Schiz-

aeaoeae .

Cladotheca HALLE.

Cladotheca undans (LmDL. ὅτ, Hu'r'r.) HALLE. (Pl. 2,
figs. 9—12.)

In a paper »On the fructifications of Jurassic fem—leaves
of the Gladophlebis denticulata-type» the present writer de-
scribed, in 1911, the sporangia of the species first known as
Pecopteris undans LINDL. δε ΗΠΤΤ. (1831-1837; vol. 2, pl.
120). The sporangia were found to differ markedly from the
structure regarded as characteristic of Todites SEW„ and
the species was accordingly brought to a new genus, Clade-
theca. This type is characterized by the shortly stalked,
pear-shaped sporangia, which have an apical cap of thick-
walled cells contrasting with the thin-walled cells in the lower
part of the sporangium.

THOMAs' (1911, p. 385) observations on the sporangia
of the English Todites Williamsoni have shown that the spor-
angia of that species, or at any rate of some specimens belonging
to it, are not of the true osmundaceous type, as was formerly
supposed. The sporangia examined by THOMAS are stated
by him to show the same general structure as those of Ola-
dotheca. As already noted in my paper of 1911, this discovery
removes the chief generic distinction between Cladotheca and
Todites. The difference in regard to the number and arrange-
ment of the sporangia was mentioned there as possibly con-

stituting a sufficient reason for keeping the two genera se-
parate. On the whole, I am inclined to think that this dif-
ference cannot outweigh the agreement in other respects.
It is possible, therefore, that Cladotheca will have to be in-
cluded in Toditoe, but there are some facts which make it
