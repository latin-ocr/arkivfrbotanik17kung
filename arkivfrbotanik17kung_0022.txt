advisable not to undertake this change of nomenclature at
present. ZELLLER's account of the sporangia of Cladophlebis
(Todea) Roesserti (PRESL) SAP. would seem to show that
there is in this case a closer resemblance to the osmundaceous
type than in the English material of Todites examined by
THOMAs. (ZEILLER 1903, p. 38 and foll.) As the fertile spe-
cimens figured by ZEILLER undoubtedly are of the {Pedites
type, as usually conceived, matters do not yet seem to be quite
clear, and the name Cladotheca has therefore been provisionally
retained.

In pl. 2, figs. 9—12, some sporangia of Gladotheoa undans
are shown. They are from the same specimen as those figured
in pl. 1 of my previous paper: those in the present pl. 2, figs.
9, 10, and 12 were also figured before. These new illustrations
are published because it has now become possible, by means
improved methods, to obtain somewhat better photographs of
these objeots‚ which are not very suitable for photographic
reproduction. The figures are intended to show the apical
cap of thick-walled cells and the radial symmetry of the spor-
angia‚ which offers a strong contrast to the dorsiventral struc-
ture of thc osmundaceous sporangium.

This type of sporangia has been found to occur in yet
another species, viz. Aspleni-tes cladophleboides M6LLER. from
the Liassic of Bornholm. In the type specimen figured by
MoLLER (1902, p. 27; pl. 2, fig. 20) only a comparatively
small number of sporangia is preserved3 but these show the
characteristic apical cap of thickened cells with sufficient-
distinctness. The type specimen of MoLLER agrees very
closely with Gladotheca undans and should probably be re-
ferred to that species.

Dictyophyllum LINDL. δυ HUTT.
Dictyophyllum exile (BRAUNS) ῌΑΤΗ. (Pl. 2, figs. 13—16.)

Of the different species of Dictyophyllwm, the Rhaetic
species D. exile (BRAUNS) NATH. seems to afford the best
material for a study of the sporangia. Especially the ma-
terial described by NATHORST (1906) displays the sporangia
with unusual distinctness.

Though several species of Dictyophyllum have been de-
