he chloroplast but may be lateral. When the daughter cells
re liberated the rupture usually occurs at a spot opposite
he nodule (figs. 12, 14, 15) although it may be near it (fig.
3). Cells were observed where there was no gelatinous
nvelope but usually the young daughter cells have their
idividual envelopes.

The cells of this variety as found at Rydboholm almost
[ways have the four angles arranged pyramidately. The
pines at the angles are more curved than TEILING figures
hem, this curving of the spine giving the cell an irregular
utline. ·

The diameter of the cells is the same as that of the
lga as I have observed it in Wisconsin but the gelatinous
rocesses are shorter, the length of those of Swedish speci-
¹lens varying from 12 to 16 μ. Since the closely related
{chinosphaeridium Nordstedtiz· LEMM. is known only from
,weden particular attention was given to the study of the
pines to see if there is a central seta as in Echinosphaeri-
ium. The gelatinous spines of the alga as found at Rydbo-
olm are entirely homogeneous and the distinction between
he two algae seems well founded.
