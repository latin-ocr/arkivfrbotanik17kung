cylinder) than of leaves or leaf-teeth. The proportion between
the number of the lists and the number of the leaves is in
Neocalamz‘tes Carrerei and N. hoerensis about 2,5 : 1, in the
geologically younger N. Nathorstii about l‚5 : 1. For an exact
ascertainment of this proportion it is necessary to be in
possession of older, full-grown stems, as at the ends of the
branches and the stems the number of furrows is most-ly the
same as the number of leaves or leaf-teeth. In the case of
N. Nathorsiz'i the scars left after the fall of the leaves do
not facilitate the computation of the above-mentioned pro-
portion, since they are not preserved on most of the spe·
cimens. It has beeneasier to find the proportion between
the number of the preserved leaves and that of the furrows.
The great distance between the leaf-bearing nodes shows that
they cannot possibly have been young stem-fragments.

Finally it may be mentioned that a couple of specimens
contain fragments which might be regarded as tubers of N eo-
calamites. It has not been possible to prove any connection
between these fragments and other rhizome-parts; but the
shape of these objects and their association with other
remains of the plant are in favour of this-interpretation.
Fig. 12 shows a little tuber, fig. 13a greater (length 30 mm,
breadth 17 mm); a third tuber is 20 mm long and 16 mm
broad. ”
