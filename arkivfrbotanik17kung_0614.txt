tion must have taken place with pollen of C. candamarcensis.
This latter species is generally found planted together with
C. chrysopetala.

The investigation of O. pentaqona gave more interesting
results. In an individual from Bafios Ι happened to find
both the heterotypic and the homotypic division of the
embryo-sac mother-cell. They are quite normal and 9 chro-
mosomes can be clearly counted (Figs. 12, 13). In the same
ovule, however, in which the homotypic metaphase of Fig. 13
is found, another cell with dividing nucleus is distinguished
(Fig. 10, 14), in which 15 chromosomes can be counted.

These chromosomes, seen in polar view of the metaphasej
are short and thick, as is usual in reduction divisions (though
a little smaller than in normal mother-cells), and quite di't'·¹
ferent from somatio chromosomes. Obviously this ovule hail
developed two mother-cells, one normal with complete res
duction, and one supernumerary, with the conjugation of th«
chromosomes almost totally absent. The latter cell most oen:
tainly contains 3 bivalent and 12 univalent chromosomes
From this it seems obvious that the physiological processo}
chromosome conjugation is in some way localized to a sp ,
cial part of the ovule. A similar case is found in anothel
ovule (Fig. 9) with both mother-cells still in prophase.
This leads us at once to make comparisons with th,
aposporical mother-cells, embryo-sacs and embryos, found b!
