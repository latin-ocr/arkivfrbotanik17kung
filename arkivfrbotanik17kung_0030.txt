transferred to l)ictyopl1!sll um by NATHORS‘s, who, however, pro-
posed to keep the genorie name for the speeies le. Brauniana
POPP. This specie>- was not figured by POPP (1863), but later 011
SCHENK, in his »Flora der Grenzschiehten», published illustr&-
tions of both Th. Brawz‘iana and T h. le'c'nsteri. As NAT-
HORs'r (1878) has pointed out, however, »SCHENK’s figures of
Th. Βγαιιηίαηα represent two different speeies, the one described
by POPP and a sec-ond type named by NATHORST Th. Schenki.
In his description of Thy. Bramziana, POPP writes »Die
&poi-angien sind iiber die ganze untere Seite zerstreut, sitzend,
und· von 61116111 vollstandigen vielgliederigen Ringe eingefasst
. . .». &cnm-11²5 description 01 ΤΙι. Βναυηῖαηα does not give
any additional information on the sori and sporangia. Of the
real Thy. Braunmna he does not· figure any sporangia. The
sporangia in pl. 18, fig. 2, which belong to Th. Scheozlci, show
a rather indistinet annulus that cannot be traeed to its whole
length.

The material 01 this speeies from the Rhaetie beds 01 t-he
ooal mine 01 Stabbarp in Scania contains well preserved fertile
specimens. The sori and sporangia have been described and
sigui-ed by NATHORST (1907). NATHORs'r gives the number of
sporangia in each sorus as about 9 (S—lO) and their diameter
as Oen—0225 111111. Ι have more 011611 found 1116 diameter to be
O‚3 mm. or even more.

The sporangia figur-ed by NATHORST (1907, pl. 2, fige. 16
17) are seen edgewise‚ and the whole extent 01 the annulus
cannot be followed. In pl. 2, figs. 25, 26, 01 1116 present Paper,
therefore, Ι have given two photographs of t-he sporangia as
seen from the side, perpendicular to the annulus. The annulus
appears 10 be somewhat twisted‚ as in Dictyophyllum exile,
and in no ease was it possible to trace its whole length. It is
probably not quite complete, in so 161 as both ends do not
meet, and 011 1116 whole it seems to be very similar to that
01 Dictyophyllum erile.

The sporangia 6611 easily be removed from t-he matrix,
and it was possible in some cases to isolate them from each
other and to count the spores after the usual treatment. For
the five sporangia of which the spores could be counted, the
