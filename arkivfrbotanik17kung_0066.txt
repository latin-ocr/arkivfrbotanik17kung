the whole number thus being 14-16 (12—18). Spore-bearing
eones about 20 mm long and 12 mm broad, the scutella of
the sporophylls hexagonal, 2—3 mm in diameter. Rhizomes
resembling the aerial stems, but with the surface more ir-
regular and not so distinctly furrowed; tubers 15 mm long
and half as broad.

The specimens were collected in 1878 by ERNST Umumns,

at that time mining engineer at the colliery of Hoganas. The ῑ

fossiliferous rock is a typical grayish shale. In many of the
specimens the cuticle of the stems is present in a carbonized
state and can be detached in the shape of long strips. We

do not, however, get the best information about the plant Ἴ

from these carbonized remains but from the impressione,
which as a rule are very distinct, smooth and a little glossy.

It is remarkable that the specimens of the rock are almost ’

entirely without remains of other plants.

This species is interesting chiefly because almost every
part of the plant is preserved. Unfortunately, however, the
spores are missing. In regard to the parts preserved the
species does not show any characteristics that could prevent
it from being ranged under the genus Equisetum.

In some species of Equisetites, Prof. HALLE has been able
to find spores, which are different from those of the existing
species of Equisetum (HALLE 1908). Maceration experiments
were made on sporophyll-fragments of the present species;
but, as has already been mentioned, the result was negative.
Some stem-fragments were also treated in the same way.
When the fragments had been for about a fortnight in the
maceration solution, it was possible to observa that the stem
was provided with stomata, which were situated in regular
longitudinal rows on the internodes. Their shape seemed to
be the same as that of the recent Equisetaceae. A cuticular
structure was plainly visible, consisting partly of thin longi-
tudinal lists with very short, rib-like protuberances lying
close together and standing out at right angles, partly of
shorter transversal dotted lines. When ammonia was added,
the whole preparation gradually dissolved, so that no draw-
ings could be made.

Fig. l gives a tolerably good illustration of the ordinary
aspect of the plant. It must have been of medium size

and much smaller than, for instance, the closely related'
