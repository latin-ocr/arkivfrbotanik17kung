in essential features. The nucleus of the megaspore mother-
cell divides, but no cell-wall and, consequenffly, no tetrad
is formed and the whole mother-cell gives rise to a bi-
nucleate embryo-sac (Fig. 7). Both nuclei soon divide, but of
&he four daughter-nuclei, thus formed, only one (that, prob-
ably, a mieropylar one!) divides again. Consequently the
mature embryo-sa.c contains but five nuclei, of
which three form the eggapparatus (Fig. 8). The other two
might be regarded as polar nuclei, though Ι

'end antipodals are lacking. An embryo-sae
bf this kind probably represents a reduced
Ι ilium-type. It is, however, not quite clear,
f the egg·cell arises from two or from three
ivisions of the megaspore mother-cell. Hence
his embryo-sac might as well be characteri-
ed as a, modification of the Plumbayella-type
cf. PALM 1915). After fertilization, a non-
ellular endosperm (most probably containing
iploid nucleil) is developed and, some-
hat later, the egg—cell divides and gives rise Fig. 7. Binuele-
