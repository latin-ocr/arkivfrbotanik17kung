Systematic account os the more noteworthy species.
Borgea gen. nov.

Cells solitary, free—floating, spherical in shape. Cell wall
thiu, invested with a tough hyaline gelatinous envelope that
is continued in four (rarely 5-8) acutely pointed broadly
based long processes. Processes of four—radiate individuals
quadrately or pyramidately arranged. Cavity of gelatinous
sheath containing the cells quadrangular or pyramidal‚ with
a small empty space at the angles between the cell wall and
sheath. Cavities of sheath at base of processes or between
them, sometimes lacking or reduced to fine nodulos. Chloro-
plast single, parietal, cup-shaped3 with one pyrenoid.

Reproduction by division of cell contents to form four
zoosporesffl) that are liberated by a fragmentation of the
cell wall into two parts.

Characters as described above.
Diameter of cells without spines 8-1ομ, with spines
25—55 μ; length of spines 12,5—22 μ.

The distinctive characters of the alga are the small num-
ber os gelatinous conical setae and the peculiar angular space&
between the sheath and. the cell wall. When these ar ''
coupled with the characteristic appearance of the empty ce
walls after reproduction has taken place it seems better td
consider it a distinct alga that to regard it as a new specied
of Echinosphaerella G. M. SMITH. ⁰

Four-spined individuals were of almost universal occur}

In general the four spines are pyramidate in arrangemeni'i'

found. The angular space between the gelatinous sheat'
and the cell wall is also quite variable3 in some specime·
it is rather conspicuous (figs. 3—4)‚ in others it appears s„
milar to the polar nodules on the walls of Oocystis cell}
(figs. 2, 7), while again it is completely lacking (figs.1,6‚9)ss-.
