presenting habitual resemblance to Marattia.. Both SEWARD
(l. c.) and THoMAs (1913, p. 228) have used Marattiopsis
for forms with typical M arattia-synangia, and for the present
it would seem to be best to follow this course. I propose,
however, to restrict 1116 1136 of the name M arattiopsis to forms
which, in synangial characters or in other respectS, agree
closely with the recent genus.

In the species known as Danaeopsis marantacea, the
structure of the sorus is now well known, and is found to dif-
fer markedly from that of M arania. Forms having 1116 30161
characters of Danaeopsis marantacea ought therefore to be
kept under a separate generic name.

KRASSER (cf. above, p. 2) 1163 stated that 1116 1161116
Danaeopsis, as used for these species, is 1101 valid because of
1116 previous existence of Danaeopsv's PRESL. This latter
name, however, is itself not 6 valid generic name and 113 exist-
ence, therefore, according 10 present rules of nomenclature,
does not constitute a sufficient ground for rejecting Danae-
opsis HR. The substitution of Pseudodanaeopsis FONT. for
Danaeopsis HR. is accordingly not warranted, according 10
1116 111163 of priority, besides being in other respects undesir-
able.

It may be questioned whether the genus should not on
strict grounds of priority be called Marantoidea, as the er-
roneous suggestion of a relationship with M arama is not ac-
cepted as a sufficient ground for rejecting an earlier name,
HEER, however, instituted his genus for a plant with a peculiar
type of fructification while Marantoidea was used for a sterile
fragment of a pinna which has not been proved to have a
similar fructification. Although there is not much doubt that
JAEGER's M arantoidea arenacea was really a sterile pinna of
Danaeopsis marantacea, it seems to be better to regard this
identity 63 1101 quite settled and therefore to retain HEER’s
genus. The name Danaeopsis it is true, is not very fortunate,
' since it suggests a resemblance to Danaea while the genus
agrees much more closely with other recent genera of the
Μαι-6111606116.

The structure of the sori and the sporangia of Danae-
opeis ‘marantacea has been differently interpreted. Sonam<
(1859, p. 1913 pl. 4, figs. 1—3)‚ who is the first to have de-
scribed 6 fertile specimen, refers the species to the genus Thau-
