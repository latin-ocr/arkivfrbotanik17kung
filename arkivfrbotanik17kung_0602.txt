arrived at similar results with Solanum, Impatiens and others
In these cases, parthenocarpy is obviously an outcome o
abundant nourishment of the flowers. In the hybrids, again
it might be regarded as an outcome of certain stimuli, which
however, lead to the same result, viz, abundant nourishmen
of the flowers. Parthenocarpy is obviously an effect of quit
special metabolic circumstances which are sometimes brough
about by crossing, sometimes through some other inter
relations between genotypical constitution and externa] fac
tors. Inter alia, the tropical climate is probably suche
factor, favourable to parthenocarpic development. Also th·
degeneration of the embryo-sacs and embryos in seedless fruiti
may certainly be brought about in more than one way. 11
any case, parthenocarpy cannot be regarded as an unques}
tionable indication of previous crossings.
