rise to an almost diploid ‹meryo-sac, which perhaps would
have been capable of further development without fertili*
zation.

The later stages of the seed-development are lacking in
my material of 0. pentaqona, so I have not been able to
decide whether apomixis takes place or not, neither have ]
seen any pollen-tubes (of C. candamarcensiss). As indicating
a beginning apomictical development, there might, perhaps
be regarded two embryo-sacs - one in the Bafios-race, one
in the Quito-race — which contained 10 and 9 nuclei res·
pectively, instead of the 5 that are generally found. This
conclusion is, of course, very uncertain, especially because
the extra nuclei might have arisen in consequence of irre·
gular distribution of the chromosomes in meiosis. If, however
apomixis really takes place, it should he characterizet] ae
apospory in the Bafios-race, whereas in the Quito-race we
cannot with certainty decide between apospory and apo·
gamy. It must be pointed out that beside the mother—cel
with the irregular meiosiS, described above, remains were
found af a collapsed cell, which, perhaps, had represented
a normal embryo5sac mother-cell, and had been forced asid
by another, aposporical one. Such collapsed cells are, Β)
the bye, often found in the archesporial region of the ovulet
of both O. pentaqona and C'. clarysopetala. A priori apospor5
must be regarded as the more probable, because the seeds
actually produced in O. pentaqona, are very few, wherea
apogamous species generally produce plenty of seeds. Or
the other hand, in the above-mentioned case, we may at
well speak of a bicellular archesporium, the two mother—cell!
showing a different degree of chromosome conjugation. Orossx
fertilization With O. candawzarcensz's is not excluded, at lea
not in the Bafios-race‚ where, as stated above, sexual em&
bryo-sacs with reduced chromosome number are developed
-— As in O. chrysopetala many ovules in this species too d]
not contain any archesporium at all. In many others th&
embryo-sac degenerates in an early stage, but even wem
developed, mature embryo-sacs are often found. 9

Summarizing we may state that the few seeds produce}
in the fruits of O. chrysopetala and O. pentaqona are eiths
of apomictical or of hybrid origin. In the latter case t ,
fertilizing pollen must have come from Ο. οαηᾱατηανσεηεὲεῇ
