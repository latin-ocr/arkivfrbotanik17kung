HALLE, ΟΝ ΤΗΕ SPORANGIA OF SOME MESOZOIO FERNS. 9

Returning to the Scanian specimen 01 D. secunda, we may
suppose that the venation of the fertile pinna was somewhat
similar to the one just described in the case 01 D. marantczcea,
only that in the former the thicker veins are alone preserved.
At any rate it is certain that the sori are more 011611 placed
between the veins than over them, and that the relation be-
tween the sori and the veins is not so regular as 111 1116 1666111
Marattiaceae.

It might perhaps be suggested that the peculiar relation
01 6011 and veins may be illusory and that the supposed veins
between the sori are really the marks 01 6 raised wall-shaped
indusium similar to that 01 Danaea. A close examination 01
1116 veins, however, shows that this is not the case, the veins
branching and joining the rachis in a manner inconsisterlt with
the idea 01 611 indusium.

The sporangia can easily be detached 110111 1116 rock.
The sporangial wall shows very little resistence to' chemical
agents. If the sporangia are treated in the usual way with
SOHULTZE’s mixture and afterwards with ammonia, their walls
are dissolved and the speres set free.

The spores (pl. 1, fig. ll) are 01 1116 tetrahedral type,
- globular, with the usual triradiate marking. Their surface is
smooth without any papillae 01 other sculpture. The dia-
meter is usually O‚06—0,07 mm, but many spores are consider-
ably smaller.

output per sporangium. Three apparently intact sporangia
were selected, and the actual result 01 1116 counting 01 1116 spores
was l 100, l 175, 1 159. 01 1116 typical numbers 01 6Ρο166,

the result of the countings may be too high: the sporangia
often overIap, and in attempting to remove the entire spor-
angia, portioris 01 adjacent ones may have been left adhering
to them. At any rate the countings give an approximate idea
01 1116 spore-output. It is not probable that the⁵ number of
5 spores per sporangium can be as high as the next higher typ-
¹ ical number or 2 048. In respect to the size 01 1116 sporangia
the spore-output is certainly surprisingly small. The num-
ber of spores in Anqiopleris is given by BowER (1908, p.
642) as l 450, and yet the sporangia 01 Dameopsis, 66 far as
