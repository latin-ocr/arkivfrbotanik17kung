This species is a small tree, 3—5 m high, often bran
ched, with broad leaves of about the same size as the leave
of the papaya. The petals are particularly characteristi-
with their reddish yellow colour and their upward·ben
ends that form a sort of small pocket. The yellow fruit i
broadest near its base3 its five angles are not very promi
nent. The pulp is yellowish—white, rather acid and ver:
juicy and fragrant. The taste and smel] of the fruit ar
much the same in this species as in the following one an·
in G. candamarcensis. The ovaries contain plenty of ovule
but only few of these reach maturity. The ripe fruit- gene
rally contains but 3-4 seeds and often not a single one.

This species is called »chamburm in the neighbourhom
of QuitO, where it is commonly cultivated up to about 3‚000 m
It is probably identical with a species, called »higacho›> (i. e
»monstrous fig»), that is cultivated in the valley of pastam}
in fact, at the village of Bafios, near the foot of the vol
cano Tunguragua‚ I saw an individua] of Carica that veri
much resembled the Quitonian »chamburo›>‚ but I did no
examine it very closely. The lower limit of the distributio}
of G. chrysopetala may thus be estimated at about 1‚500 m
Type specimens from Quito, Guapulo and Caraburo. Th
photograph, Pl. I, shows an individual from the last-me

tioned place.
